# Save-and-click-program
is an automatization program build in pythonfor making clicks to the screen and after that the software automaticly saves those click, moves the cursor to the right area and make the proper click


in this initial realease the button 1 2 and 3 is for uploading the coord of the clicks in 3 different text files, 
after all of the coords are uploaded the 1 and 2 are the really important ones because the third one is the same as the first one, after you upload all the clicks you reiniciate the program with button r, so after that you press letter f, to let the program work either with coordinates 1 or 2, the diference between these two are that the coordinates 2 will be executed and repeated 105 times, after that it will finish

the coordinates 1 will only be executed once,

there are 6 elements in every click in the text file, the first one are the coordinates in x and y of the screen the second one are the colors of that particular point, the third one is the speed between all of the clicks, after that the text that says bucle, is for another loop itself, if you dont change it it will do nothing, but if you want to change it the first number is for the amount of time that it will have between different clicks in that precise point and the second number is the amount of clicks it will have in that particular point
